"""Convert a doctor's RTSTRUCT tumor outline into a 3D binary mask.

RTSTRUCT stores the tumor as contour lines drawn on each slice. PyRadiomics
needs a voxel mask (1 = tumor, 0 = background) aligned with the CT volume,
so we rasterize the contours with rt-utils.

In NSCLC-Radiomics the tumor ROI is typically named like "GTV-1" — always
verify with list_rois() on your first patient before batching.
